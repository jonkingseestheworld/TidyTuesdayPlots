#TidyTuesday
</h1>

Here is a collection of my data viz inspirations and attempts on the weekly data source from TidyTuesday.

## Background Information 
Taken from [R For Data Science](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) TidyTuesday
> TidyTuesday is a weekly data project activity aimed mainly at the R ecosystem. The project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, with an emphasis on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem.

Since early 1980s, the average annual temperature has increased continually.
