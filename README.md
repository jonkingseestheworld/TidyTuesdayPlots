#TidyTuesday
</h1>

Here is a collection of my data viz inspirations and attempts on the weekly data source from TidyTuesday.

## Background Information 
Taken from [R For Data Science](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) TidyTuesday
> TidyTuesday is a weekly data project activity aimed mainly at the R ecosystem. The project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, with an emphasis on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem.
